# Assignment-8-Inherited-Traits
Intro to Programming assignment 8
Working as a group, create a Python program that:

Has a class, Parent, with the following attributes/methods:
name, age, gender, height, eyeColor, hairColor, talents (a list)
describe
makeChild
Has a class, Child, with the custom method “goToSchool”
Use “pass” to allow the method to be empty
Instantiates a “Father” object and a “Mother” object
Instantiates 3 Child objects (child1, child2, child3) USING THE MAKE CHILD METHOD:
Using random, assign inherited (in the biological sense) values to each child’s attributes via the “makeChild” method
This should also apply to gender
child1 and child2’s talents should be chosen randomly from their Parents’ talent lists; child3 should have at least one that is unique to them (i.e. a talent neither Parent has)
Adds each person to a list, people
Describes each person
